Error from server (NotFound): secrets "argocd-initial-admin-secret" not found

It looks like you're trying to retrieve the initial admin password for Argo CD, but the secret `argocd-initial-admin-secret` wasn't found in the `argocd` namespace. This usually happens when Argo CD wasn't installed correctly, or the secret was deleted.

Here's how you can troubleshoot this and get your admin password:

**1. Verify Argo CD Installation:**

* **Check if Argo CD is running:** `kubectl get pods -n argocd`
    * Make sure the `argocd-server` pod is in a `Running` state.
* **Check if the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` was created:**
    * If you installed Argo CD using the standard manifests, the secret should exist. Try searching for it in all namespaces: `kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces | grep argocd-initial-admin-secret`

**2.  If Argo CD is not running:**

* **Reinstall Argo CD:** Follow the official Argo CD installation guide to ensure you have a clean installation.
* **Check installation logs:** Look for any errors during the installation process.

**3. If Argo CD is running, but the secret is missing:**

* **Retrieve the password from the server logs:**
    *  `kubectl logs -n argocd <argocd-server-pod-name> | grep 'Admin password:'`
    * Replace `<argocd-server-pod-name>` with the actual pod name.
* **Generate a new admin password:**
    *  If you can't find the password in the logs, you can generate a new one using the `argocd admin initial-password` command.

**4.  If you are using a different secret name:**

* **Update the command:** If you customized the secret name during installation, make sure to use the correct name in your `kubectl` command.

**Important Notes:**

* **Security Best Practices:**  The initial admin password is highly sensitive.  Change it immediately after logging in for the first time.
* **GitOps:** In a true GitOps environment, secrets like this should be managed through your Git repository and applied to your cluster using Argo CD itself.

If you're still stuck, please provide more information about your Argo CD installation, such as:

* How you installed Argo CD (e.g., using the official manifests, Helm chart, Operator).
* Any customizations you made during the installation.
* Any relevant error messages you encountered.

This will help me give you more specific guidance.

Okay, it seems like Argo CD is running in the `argocd` namespace, but the `argocd-initial-admin-secret` is indeed missing. 

Let's try to retrieve the password from the server logs:

1. **Get the `argocd-server` pod name:** You already have the pod list. Copy the exact name of the pod that starts with `argocd-server`. It looks like it's `argocd-server-6997845b6-bv9g6` in your case.

2. **Retrieve the password from the logs:** Run the following command, replacing `<argocd-server-pod-name>` with the actual pod name:

```bash
kubectl logs -n argocd argocd-server-6997845b6-bv9g6 | grep 'Admin password:'
```

This command will print the logs of the Argo CD server pod and filter for the line containing the admin password.

If you can't find the password in the logs, you'll need to generate a new one:

1. **Generate a new password:**
   ```bash
   argocd admin initial-password
   ```
   This command will generate a new random password and update the `argocd-initial-admin-secret`. You can then retrieve it using the original command you tried:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
   ```

Remember to change this generated password as soon as you log in to Argo CD for the first time.

It seems like the `argocd` command is not available in your current shell environment. This means the Argo CD CLI is not installed or not in your PATH.

Here's how to fix it:

**1. Install the Argo CD CLI:**

  - **Download the binary:** You can download the latest release for your operating system from the Argo CD releases page: [https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases)
  - **Make it executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x argocd-linux-amd64 
    ```
    (Replace `argocd-linux-amd64` with the actual filename)
  - **Move it to your PATH:**
    ```bash
    sudo mv argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
    ```

**2. Add to PATH (if already installed):**

  - If you already have the `argocd` binary installed but it's not in your PATH, find its location and add it to your `PATH` environment variable. For example, if it's located in `/home/youruser/bin`:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/home/youruser/bin
    ```

**3. Verify installation:**

  - Check if the `argocd` command is now available:
    ```bash
    argocd version
    ```

Once you have the Argo CD CLI installed and available in your PATH, you can try generating a new password again:

```bash
argocd admin initial-password
```

Then, retrieve the password:

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

If you still face issues, please provide the following information:

  - Your operating system.
  - How you installed Argo CD originally.
  - The output of `echo $PATH`.

This will help me understand your environment better and provide more specific guidance.
