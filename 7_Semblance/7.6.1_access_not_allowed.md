Thanks for the clarification! Since you're using GitHub Codespaces and serving a basic HTML page that accesses a `data.json` file, the CORS error is likely occurring because your HTML page is trying to fetch data from a file or API that’s restricted by the browser's CORS policy.

Here are the steps to address the issue:

### 1. **Serving the Files from a Local Server (Recommended)**

By default, accessing local files directly with an HTML page can lead to CORS issues. The most reliable approach in Codespaces is to serve your HTML page and JSON file using a local development server. 

You can use a simple HTTP server like `http-server` (Node.js-based) to serve your files.

#### Steps to Set Up:
1. Open the terminal in Codespaces.
2. Install `http-server` globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory where your HTML file and `data.json` file are located.
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   http-server -p 8080
   ```
   This will serve the files at `http://localhost:8080/`.

5. Now, in your HTML file, change the paths to access the `data.json` file via the server URL:
   ```javascript
   fetch('http://localhost:8080/data.json')
   ```

### 2. **Setting up CORS Headers for the Server**

If you're using a custom server or API in Codespaces, ensure that CORS headers are enabled for your routes. Here’s how to enable CORS in a Node.js/Express server:

#### Example (if using Node.js/Express):
1. Install the `cors` middleware:
   ```bash
   npm install cors
   ```
2. In your server code (e.g., `server.js`), add:
   ```javascript
   const cors = require('cors');
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Enable CORS for all routes
   app.use(cors());

   // Serve your static files (like data.json)
   app.use(express.static('public'));

   // Start the server
   app.listen(8080, () => {
       console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:8080');
   });
   ```

3. Ensure `data.json` is in the `public` folder or modify the path accordingly.

### 3. **Accessing Data via a Simple Fetch Call**

Once your server is up and running with CORS headers, your fetch call in your HTML should work without issues:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:8080/data.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
```

### 4. **Accessing from Codespaces URL (Optional)**

If you want to access the server externally (outside Codespaces), Codespaces provides a public URL that you can use to access your server. You can find this URL in the "Ports" tab of the Codespaces interface.

1. Look for the port `8080` in the "Ports" tab.
2. Use the public URL provided, like `https://<your-codespace>.githubpreview.dev`, and update the fetch URL in your HTML:
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://<your-codespace>.githubpreview.dev/data.json')
   ```

This should allow you to fetch the JSON data without running into CORS issues.

Let me know if you need further help with this setup!

If you prefer not to install Node.js or use an external server like `http-server`, you can still avoid the CORS issue by using a simple method that doesn’t require server setup. Since you're working with GitHub Codespaces, the simplest approach is to open the HTML file directly with a local server provided by the Codespaces environment without installing anything extra.

Here are the steps to serve your HTML and JSON files directly from GitHub Codespaces:

### 1. **Use the Built-In Codespaces Web Preview**

Codespaces allows you to preview your project without needing to install extra dependencies. You can use the built-in web preview feature to serve your files and avoid CORS issues. Here's how:

#### Steps:
1. **Place your files (HTML and `data.json`) in the same directory** in the Codespace workspace.
2. **Open the file in the Codespaces editor** (for example, `index.html`).
3. In the Codespaces interface, look for the **"Ports" tab** (usually on the bottom right or in the left menu).
4. You should see your `index.html` listed, and the associated port (for example, `8080` or another port if set).
5. **Click on the "Open in Browser" button** next to the port. This will open the HTML file in a preview, and now your `data.json` can be fetched without CORS restrictions as the previewed page will be served in a way that handles cross-origin requests properly.

#### Example:
Your HTML should now use the same URL as shown in the preview:
```javascript
fetch('/data.json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
```

### 2. **Using the Direct File System Access (For Quick Tests)**

If you don’t want to use a preview server at all and just want to test things directly, you can open the `index.html` locally in the browser. However, this will lead to the CORS issue when trying to fetch local files (like `data.json`), because most browsers restrict local file access for security reasons. Therefore, using the preview server method is the most seamless way.

### 3. **Using GitHub Pages (For Production)**

If you're looking to make your project accessible online without running a server, you could use GitHub Pages. This will host your HTML and JSON files with no need for local server configurations.

- **Push your project to a GitHub repository.**
- Go to the repository's settings.
- Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section and select the branch to serve (usually `main` or `gh-pages`).
- After a few minutes, you’ll have a public URL where your HTML and `data.json` can be accessed, and CORS issues won’t occur since it's hosted on GitHub's servers.

### Summary
The best approach for **no installation and no extra setup** is using the **Codespaces built-in web preview**, which allows you to serve and view your project in a browser without needing to configure a separate server. This method works well for development and testing purposes without installing additional tools like `http-server`.
