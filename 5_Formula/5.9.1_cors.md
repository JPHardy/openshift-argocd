CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how web pages can request resources from domains other than their own. It helps prevent malicious websites from accessing resources or data on another website without permission.

For example, if a webpage hosted on `www.example1.com` tries to fetch data from `www.example2.com`, CORS is used to determine whether this is allowed. The server at `example2.com` can specify which domains are permitted to access its resources by setting specific HTTP headers, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. If the request is from a domain that's not allowed, the browser will block the request, preventing potential security risks.

To summarise, CORS ensures that sensitive resources are only accessible by trusted sources, protecting users from malicious activities like cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and data theft.
