# Streamlining Your CI/CD Workflow with Minikube and GitOps

Minikube clusters can streamline your CI/CD workflow by integrating GitOps practices. This blog post will guide you through setting up ArgoCD, configuring Helm, and deploying an application on a Minikube cluster. We will cover the following steps:

1. **Setting Up Minikube Cluster**
2. **Installing ArgoCD on Minikube**
3. **Configuring Helm on Minikube**
4. **Deploying an Application using Helm and ArgoCD**

Let's dive in!

## 1. Setting Up Minikube Cluster

Minikube provides a local Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to test and develop on Kubernetes locally. Follow these steps to get your Minikube cluster up and running:

### Step 1: Install Minikube

Download and install Minikube from the official Minikube website. Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements. Once installed, start the Minikube cluster:

```bash
minikube start
```

### Step 2: Log in to Kubernetes

After starting Minikube, you can interact with your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

This command should show the Minikube node.

## 2. Installing ArgoCD on Minikube

To deploy Argo CD using Helm, you need to follow several steps to ensure a smooth installation and configuration of the tool. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. Argo CD is a popular continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, which makes it easy to implement GitOps practices by managing application deployments in a declarative manner.

### Step 1: Install Helm

If you haven't installed Helm yet, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Step 2: Add the Argo CD Helm repository

First, add the Argo CD Helm repository to your Helm client:

```bash
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update
```

### Step 3: Create a Namespace for Argo CD

It's a good practice to deploy Argo CD in its own namespace. Create a namespace for Argo CD:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

### Step 4: Install Argo CD using Helm

Now, use Helm to install Argo CD into the namespace you just created. You can use the default values or customize them as needed.

To install Argo CD with the default settings, run:

```bash
helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd
```

### Step 5: Check the Installation

To verify that Argo CD has been installed correctly, you can check the pods running in the `argocd` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

You should see several pods, including `argocd-server`, `argocd-repo-server`, `argocd-redis`, and others.

### Step 6: Access the Argo CD UI

By default, Argo CD's API server is not exposed via a LoadBalancer or Ingress. You can access it using `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

Now you can open your web browser and go to `https://localhost:8080` to access the Argo CD web UI.

### Step 7: Login to Argo CD

The initial password for the admin user is auto-generated and stored in a Kubernetes secret. To get this password, run:

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

or for PowerShell users:

```powershell
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | ForEach-Object { [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($_)) }
```

Use the username `admin` and the password you retrieved to log in to the Argo CD UI.

### Step 8: (Optional) Customize Argo CD Installation

If you need to customize your Argo CD installation, you can create a `values.yaml` file and specify your custom configurations there. Hereâ€™s an example command to install Argo CD with custom values:

Create a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
server:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
```

Install Argo CD using the custom `values.yaml`:

```bash
helm install argocd argo/argo-cd --namespace argocd -f values.yaml
```

This will install Argo CD with the specified customizations.

## Summary

You've now deployed Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm! You can customize further based on your requirements, such as enabling SSL, configuring authentication, or setting up Argo CD projects and applications.

If you have any further questions or need more customization details, feel free to ask!
